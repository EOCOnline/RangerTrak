<h2>About</h2>
<br>
<div>
  <p>Version {{version}}</p>
  <p>This is a sample application for tracking & mapping CERT, ACS, other
    teams, rangers & individuals roaming around, who are only reliably
    connected via HAM radio or other non-data supporting means. They can
    radio in their locations - in a variety of formats, and be centrally tracked.</p>
  <p> This should be able to function (with some degredation) even if the person
    using this is offline also.</p>

  <p> Items requiring online access: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>GeoCoding an address</li>
    <li>All maps (for now)</li>
    <li>3Word functionality (for now)</li>
  </ul>
